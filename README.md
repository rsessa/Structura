# Structura

**Structura** is a modern, native, and self-contained desktop application designed to write, preview, and export [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams in real time without requiring an internet connection.

Built with **Tauri v2**, **Vite**, and **Vanilla JS**, it uses raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to maintain maximum lightness and energy efficiency, all packaged under an ultrafast native Rust backend.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dual-Window Architecture**: Natively separates your workspace using dual monitors.
  - **Window 1 (Editor)**: A dark, code-focused text editor.
  - **Window 2 (Viewer)**: An expansive canvas that reacts instantly to every keystroke.
- **Offline by Design**: The entire Mermaid visualization library is embedded in the app. No resources are blocked by CORS, and there are no CDN server response times.
- **Tab System**: Work on multiple diagrams in parallel, syncing their live visualization between both windows.
- **Smart Editor**:
  - Real and smart Indentation handling (`Tab` works as expected).
  - Includes a one-click **Auto-format** engine that structures your Mermaid code properly.
  - Supports the base `sequenceDiagram` standard and the entire official Mermaid suite.
- **Fast Export**: Copy the source code or export the final rendered graph as `SVG` directly to your clipboard.
- **Enclave Integration**: Export your generated diagram directly and natively to the Enclave input directory (`C:\scripts\DataAnalisis\inbox_diagram.svg`), facilitating an offline workflow.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

Structura is very easy to modify and build.

**Prerequisites:**
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or higher).
2. [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) environment with Rust/Cargo installed (via `rustup`).

### Installing dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Development mode
Starts a static web server live-connected to the native Tauri window packager. You will witness all changes instantly in app format:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## 📦 Build and Packaging

You can generate the desktop application yourself for distribution.

### 1. Standard Windows Installer (.exe MSI/NSIS)
Produces the official installer that adds Structura to Windows programs (Start Menu, Classic Uninstall, etc.):
```bash
npm run tauri build
```
The installer is saved in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

### 2. Standalone / Portable Version (.exe Direct)
If you just want to pass the app to a colleague or use it from a flash drive **without requiring any prior installation on Windows**, simply locate the underlying executable generated by Rust.

After running the Build process above, it is always found at:
```
src-tauri/target/release/app.exe
```
**(Just rename that file to `Structura-Portable.exe` and you are good to go).*
